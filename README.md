Indigenous Storyteller is a unique project that taps into the power of Open Data and Generative AI to create informative, engaging, and immersive stories based on indigenous cultures. Focusing on Australian indigenous languages, the project uses an open-source dataset provided by the Queensland government, which contains a wealth of information on the local indigenous tongues.

Currently, AI has limited comprehension of these languages due to scarcity of data. This project aims to bridge this gap by providing AI with the necessary data to understand and interpret these languages effectively.

The data input to the system includes language name, pronunciation, common words, geographical locations, images, and other related information. While AI may not produce informative contents independently, this additional data allows it to weave fascinating narratives based on indigenous culture, highlighting the uniqueness and diversity of different tribes' languages and cultures.

### Objectives

* To create an interactive learning platform for people interested in learning indigenous languages
* To help indigenous people rediscover, embrace, and preserve their cultural identity
* To advance AI capabilities in language comprehension, particularly less-documented indigenous languages
